CRC brings a minimal OpenShift Container Platform 4 cluster or a MicroShift cluster to your local computer. These runtimes provide minimal environments for development and testing purposes. CRC is mainly targeted at running on developers' desktops. For other OpenShift Container Platform use cases, such as headless or multi-developer setups, use the [full OpenShift installer](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install).

See the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/welcome/index.html#developer-activities) for a full introduction to OpenShift Container Platform.

CRC includes the `crc` command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the CRC instance using the desired container runtime.
[podman-desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) provides a graphical user interface for `crc` through its OpenShift Local extension.

You can download Red Hat's builds of CRC as Red Hat OpenShift Local from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local.
